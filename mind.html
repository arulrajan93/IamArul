  <h1>Mind of Arul</h1>

  <p>
    This is where I write — not to impress, but to think clearly.
    Ideas about systems, learning, discipline, work, and life.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What I’m learning</li>
    <li>What I’m questioning</li>
    <li>What I’m building</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Over time, this becomes a map of how my thinking evolves.
