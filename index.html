    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I learn by building — breaking things, fixing them, and refining the process.
      I’m not interested in noise, trends, or complexity for its own sake.
      </p>
      <p>
      I focus on creating systems that reduce friction, automate the boring,
      and bring clarity to work and life. Progress matters more than perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
      This website is my space to think out loud, document what I learn,
      and share systems that actually work.
      </p>
    
      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Design simple workflows that reduce unnecessary effort</li>
        <li>Build automation using scripts, tools, and integrations</li>
        <li>Document systems so knowledge doesn’t stay trapped in my head</li>
        <li>Turn vague ideas into clear, usable structures</li>
      </ul>
